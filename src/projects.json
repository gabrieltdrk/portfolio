It doesn't have a single meaning but is used in a variety of ways in the everyday language of people from Minas Gerais.

        "description": "Achieving first place in the first hackathon held at Universidade Santa Cec√≠lia, focused on the company Grupo FCamara, this marks the beginning of a 'portfolio hub' where people can easily and effectively showcase their projects. It's a tool created to help new programmers share their projects quickly and efficiently. We know that at the start of their careers, many face difficulties finding a space or platform to showcase their work. With this in mind, Orange Portfolio was designed to allow both members and non-members of the Orange Juice community to share their projects easily. With a simple and intuitive interface, our users can upload, edit, and delete their work with ease.",
